# CSV Combiner
CSV Combiner is a Java desktop application designed to combine multiple CSV files from a selected directory into a single master CSV file while removing duplicate entries. This tool simplifies the process of consolidating CSV data, making it ideal for users who need to merge datasets that share the same structure (e.g. bank transaction history).

## Purpose
The CSV Combiner aims to streamline data management tasks by:
- Selecting a Source Directory: Allows users to choose a folder containing multiple CSV files for consolidation.
- Verifying File Structure: Ensures all CSV files have the same headers and structure before merging.
- Combining Data: Merges data from all validated CSV files into one comprehensive master file.
- Removing Duplicates: Identifies and eliminates duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
This application is particularly useful for aggregating transaction records, logs, or any other data spread across multiple CSV files, saving time and reducing the risk of errors associated with manual data handling.
